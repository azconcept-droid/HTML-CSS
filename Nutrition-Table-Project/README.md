It's very common in JavaScript to return a string that represents some HTML code. String interpolation comes in handy here because it supports multi-line strings and interpolation.

Complete the function renderTableRow such that it returns the following HTML:

<tr>
    <td>label here</td>
    <td>value here</td>
</tr>
